The criteria for password attributes include length (8-128), uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters.

To generate, the user can click Generate Password button or press any key on the keyboard. 

The generator uses a series of user prompts to gather attributes. It leverages rando.js to randomize the passwords.
